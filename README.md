# baby-smash

Looking for help to improve this app:
1. make it completely full screen. Right now on Ubuntu the top power button is still visible
2. trap and ignore alt-tab (way to exit app is to type: "exitnow" case insensitive, exit now already works)
3. make the graphics responsive to child's key presses and mouse movements (draw shapes, play music)
4. Sound option : on or off. 
5. Mode: Auto play,  only respond to input mode or a combo of both. 
  a. Auto play means keep doing own thing and ignore user input.
  b. user input mode means don't do anything automatically, only react to user input
  c. Combo : waits for  input, if no input in 10 seconds it plays a sound and draws something. If there is user input then auto mode is 

App to allow your child to play with your keyboard mouse without affecting your work on other windows.
Can download runnable jar from the release folder. Double click it. Needs Java 7 or later to be installed.

Code is in the quick folder. Right now alt-tab is not captured. So pressing Alt-tab will change the window and make baby-smash useless. But most babies do not know how to press that so its unlikely.
